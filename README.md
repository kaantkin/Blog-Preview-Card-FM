## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive layout

### What I learned

During development I improved my use of semantic HTML and accessability. I also implemented grid layout to set the layout of the side and flexbox to align items. I also learnt about scss and how to implement it, alongside some practices. I further improved on response-first structure, attempting to maximise responsibility on all elements.

### Continued development

I will continue to develop on scss and further my knowledge and use of semantic HTML and accessability.
